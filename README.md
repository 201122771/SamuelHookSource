## SAMUELHOOK
A project that was discontinued after 3+ years. I had a great time developing this project, it amased over 4K active users too!
It blew my mind to see that I could do that, and it was all cause of you guys. Honestly, some of the greatest learning points.

## ABOUT DEVELOPMENT
This projects source isn't really "meant for learning." You definitely can learn from it, just depends on your knowledge.
But, this was the **FINAL REWRITE** before I discontinued the project. Not all games were implemented, I had bigger plans but was never able to reach 'em.

## CONTRIBUTING
If you'd like to learn from this that's totally fine, if you use any code I'd appreciate credit.
